The chaos libraries are used to define the protocol used by a service
provider. For example, if a module provides the service "log", it will
use structures from a library called "log".

This is not 100% strict though, since some libraries (like the string
and memory library) don't use nor contact a service provider at
all. Maybe we should move these somewhere else?
