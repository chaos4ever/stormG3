Here, information about protocols is stored. The implementation of a
protocol is three-layered:

  * Layer 1: one or more modules implementing the protocol. (this is
    called a "service")
  * Layer 2: a library for accessing services implementing this
    protocol from within kernel modules. (Using near calls, which
    means very good performance)
  * Layer 3: a library for accessing services implementing this
    protocol from userspace.
