README ($Id$)
======

Here, all programs included with chaos are put. Right now all of them
are installed into /system/programs so we put everything in this
directory, but eventually we may think about having a "foreign"
directory for example (for stuff supplied by third parties like GNU or
BSD or Microsoft... :-)
