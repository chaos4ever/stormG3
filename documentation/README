README ($chaos$)
======

Here we put system-overall documentation, like the FHS. The documentation
format that we prefer is Docbook XML; see http://www.docbook.org for more
information about how to use this DTD.

Component-specific documentation like stormG3 design is not to be put here but
rather under the sub-project's directory.
