  Introduction
  
  As computers became more advanced, the need to structure data arise, files 
  were invented. A file was, and still is, a sequence of data (bits/bytes)
  associated with a name (the filename). But people soon realised that
  wasn't enough, and the concept of directories were added. Instead of
  storing all files on the same place, files were grouped up together in
  directories. It was also possible to store directories in directories
  (often called sub-directories), making the possibilities virtually
  endless.

  The concepts with files and directories is used in almost all computer
  systems today, and chaos will use a similiar system. This document defines
  how files and directories should be structured in chaos.
