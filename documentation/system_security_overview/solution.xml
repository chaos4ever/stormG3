    <title>The Solution</title>
    <para>
      The solution is called
      <emphasis>Capabilities</emphasis>. Instead of mapping user ID 0
      to the super user, and letting that user do all the fun stuff,
      the idea is to map this into a set of capabilities, like
      <literal>kernel::set_user_id</literal>,
      <literal>vfs::adopt_file</literal>,
      <literal>ipv4::bind_low_port</literal>, and so on. This list of
      capabilities is not hard-wired into the kernel, but is an
      extensible list of strings so it is easy to add a new capability
      that we need without having to recompile (and restart) the
      kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
      For compatibility with legacy (GNU and other Unix) systems, we
      will also have a <literal>kernel::super_user</literal>
      capability that is set on a certain user. That capability is the
      <emphasis>root</emphasis> of other capabilities and thus, a user
      with the <literal>kernel::super_user</literal> capability will
      automatically inherit all other capabilities as well.
