    <title>Capability classes</title>
    <para>
      Not all capability classes that have been defined are listed
      here; only those of very important priority. In general, all
      services have a capability class with the same name as the
      service. For example, the ipv4 service has a set of capabilities
      called <literal>ipv4::listen_tcp_80</literal>,
      <literal>ipv4::send_udp_67</literal> and so on. Another thing
      that should be mentioned is the fact that all capability classes
      should have the <literal>class::super_user</literal> capability,
      inheriting its value from the
      <literal>kernel::super_user</literal> capability. This makes it
      very easy to make the system "Unix compatible" by giving a
      certain user full access to everything.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              All kernel-related
              capabilities are put into this capability class. The root
              capability here is called
              <literal>kernel::super_user</literal>. A user with the
              capability of super-user is granted access to everything
              in the system.
