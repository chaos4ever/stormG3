==========

This is something like a road map for chaos as I see it:

M1
--
Finish memory allocation (physical, global and virtual) AND
deallocation. Physical and global allocation and deallocation works,
virtual allocation and deallocation remains to be done. Also, support
physical allocation of more than 1 page through sweep-and-scan
technique.

M2
--
stormG3 should be ready for development. Support processes and
threads, multi-tasking, IRQ:s, DMA and modules (with services).

M3
--
Play a .MOD file in chaos, running stormG3. This involves porting the
old Sound Blaster code and adapt it to the new architecture.

M4
--
Porting all existing chaos code to the new stormG3 system, doing the
neccessary adaptions.

M??
---
Have the POSIX/ISO library support all that is needed to run common
daily Unix programs, like bash, Apache, MySQL, gcc. This will provide
a good base for writing the "real" chaos applications like tornado,
cAPS and so on.
