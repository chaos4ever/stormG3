==========

This is something like a road map for chaos as I see it:

M1
--
Finish module support, with services.

M2
--
Implement virtual memory allocation and deallocation and use it for
process creation. Support physical allocation of more than 1 page
through sweep-and-scan technique.

M3
--
stormG3 should be ready for development. Support processes and
threads, multi-tasking, IRQ:s, DMA and modules (with services).

M4
--
Play a .MOD file in chaos, running stormG3. This involves porting the
old Sound Blaster code and adapt it to the new architecture.

M5
--
Porting all existing chaos code to the new stormG3 system, doing the
neccessary adaptions.

M??
---
Have the POSIX/ISO library support all that is needed to run common
daily Unix programs, like bash, Apache, MySQL, gcc. This will provide
a good base for writing the "real" chaos applications like tornado,
cAPS and so on.
