(Note: The information below is quite old and kept for reference only. stormG3 was never finished, and any new work - if any - is performed in the main chaos repo instead: http://github.com/chaos4ever/chaos)

This is chaos, a free (licensed under the BSD license, without
advertisment clause) operating system. It implements advanced features
such as virtual memory, interrupt/exception management, memory
protection, I/O protection, preemptive multitasking, ELF support, and
much, much more. It is a work in progress, and thus many parts are
yet unfinished. If you are a programmer and would like to help us,
please contact us and we can see what you can help us with.

The following programs are required to compile:

* gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org, 3.0 or better is *required*)
* GNU CONS. (http://www.gnu.org/software/cons)
* GNU binutils. (http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)

chaos is known to run correctly on the following computers (at some
time):

* No-name Pentium 133 MHz (32 MiB RAM)
* AMD Athlon Thunderbird 900MHz (256 MiB RAM)
* AMD Athlon 700 MHz (128 MiB RAM)

If you successfully compile/run it on another platform, with or
without patches, please tell us! Any experiences are welcome. Don't
forget to check out http://chaos.lundcom.se/
