This is chaos, a free (licensed under the BSD license without
advertisment clause) operating system. It implements advanced features
such as virtual memory, interrupt/exception management, memory
protection, I/O protection, preemptive multitasking, ELF support, and
much, much more. It is a work in progress, and thus some parts might
be unfinished. If you are a programmer and would like to help us,
please contact us and we can see what you can help us with. Our
contact information can be found on the web page --

The following programs are required to compile:

* gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org, 3.0 or better is *required*)
* GNU CONS. (http://www.gnu.org/software/cons)
* GNU binutils.

Please consult README.Linux or README.FreeBSD for some (possibly
outdated) help about building the system under your specific
system. If you're running anything else, you're totally on yourself.
