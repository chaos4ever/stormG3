This is chaos, a free (licensed under the BSD license, without
advertisment clause) operating system. It implements advanced features
such as virtual memory, interrupt/exception management, memory
protection, I/O protection, preemptive multitasking, ELF support, and
much, much more. It is a work in progress, and thus many parts are
yet unfinished. If you are a programmer and would like to help us,
please contact us and we can see what you can help us with. Our
contact information can be found on the web page --

The following programs are required to compile:

* gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org, 3.0 or better is *required*)
* GNU CONS. (http://www.gnu.org/software/cons)
* GNU binutils.

Please consult README.Linux for some (possibly outdated) help about
building the system under your specific system. If you're running
anything else, you're on yourself. Though, the people in #chaos on
irc.chaosdev.org might be able to help you.

chaos is known to run correctly on the following computers (at some
time):

* No-name Pentium 133 MHz (32 MiB RAM)
* AMD Athlon Thunderbird 900MHz (256 MiB RAM)

If you successfully compile/run it on another platform, with or
without patches, please tell us! Any experiences are welcome. Don't
forget to check out http://web.chaosdev.org/
